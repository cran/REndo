Description: Fits linear models with endogenous regressor using latent
    instrumental variable approaches. The methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997)
    higher moments approach as well as Lewbel's (2012) heteroskedasticity approach, Park and Gupta's (2012) joint estimation method that uses Gaussian
    copula and Kim and Frees's (2007) multilevel generalized method of moment approach that deals with endogeneity in a multilevel setting. 
    These are statistical techniques to address the endogeneity problem where no external instrumental variables are needed.
